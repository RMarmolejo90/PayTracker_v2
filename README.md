# PayTrack
 This is a personal website project.

 The website will stand as a personal portfolio of sorts. I intend to add new features and content to the site through continuos integration after the first version is produced. The first version of the website will include a PayTrack app as its main feature. I will also include some information about me as an individual. 

 PayTrack -
 Is an app designed for tracking your work hours and pay checks, as an hourly employee. What makes this app unique, is that it shows you, in REAL-TIME, how much money you have made during your shift, and for the week. Every hourly paying job will always tell you, "track your hours and make sure you are getting paid appropriately". This makes it convenient to clock yourself in and out of work every day, and see how much money you are making. The app is NOT MEANT TO BE 100% ACCURATE WITH YOUR PAY ESTIMATE. It is intended to give you a rough estimate that is usually very close to what you should expect on your real pay check. The actual deductions and pay structures always vary, and this app is not intended to track with that kind of accuracy. The purpose is really just to help you keep track of your work hours, and get a good estimate for how much you should expect on your pay check. Its also a good motivator, for when you need to remind yourself why you're working so many hours.

 The app will start with basic functionality in version one, and I intend to improve upon it through multiple updated versions. The first version will include the following features:
 1. a simple clock-in, clock-out.
 2. changes in deduction rates, and pay rate.
 3. a timer, displaying your current shift time (how long you've been working so far).
 4. active net pay and gross pay for the current working shift.
 5. active net pay and gross pay for the current week.
 6. will display if you have reached overtime or not.
 7. will add 1.5x pay rate for overtime hours.
 8. will store a history log of the past six weeks of shifts.
 9. will have a history page where you can view the history.
 10. will have a clock-in & clock-out button, a history button.

Restrictions for the first version:
1. Will only work with weekly pay cycles, not set up for bi-weekly. This is because if I added this functionality, I would want to create a setup screen where the user could enter if its weekly or biweekly pay, and the app would adjust the pay cycles and overtime calculations accordingly.
2. Overtime rate is not adjustable.
3. There is no pause or lunch break functionality.
4. No config or settings screen.
5. Deletes records after 6 weeks, to save space in the database.
6. Work week always ends Monday 12:00AM.

The website is built using the MERN stack. The front-end will be installed with Vite instead of create-react-app. I am considering other cool content to add to the website besides the PayTrack app.
